responsive-jPlayer
==================

A responsive audio player utilizing the open source jPlayer library and circle player. This player has a static playlist that can be defined with an XML file and is loaded using an ajax request.

I'll apologize ahead of time for how disorganized this repo is. In the near future, I'll be doing some housekeeping to overall file structure.
